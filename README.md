# PythonShadyPrototype
Prototype Python version of a larger random maths worksheet generator I created using VBA.

20 calculations are randomly generated, in the form of a left-hand operand and a right-hand operand, and then a randomly selected operator from the seven arithmetic operators ("+","-","*","/","%","**","//") between them.  A grid of 40 possible answers, i.e., 20 are correct and 20 are wrong is displayed to the user.  The user (a keen mathematician wanting to practice their calculation skills) does each calculation and then matches up their answer with the answer hidden in the grid.  You also have the option of choosing a particular operator and producing multiple sets of questions for more practice; you can also "export" questions sets to a pdf.

The full VBA + Excel version produces pdf documents, where the user shades in the answer they found and then has their shading compared with an answer sheet containing the shaded pattern for that pdf (student pdf has a unique code which matches with answers sheets produced for the teacher).  I also have a version where the answers when shaded in create a visually recognised patter which can the just be mark quickly by eye.

The main idea / driving force for these sheets is that practice makes better more confident and sometime perfect mathematicians.  As each worksheet is randomly different from the students peer, they cannot copy answers, but are encouraged to tell peers how to do it.
